# Data Retrieval: Advanced SELECT Statements, Filtering, and Sorting

## Advanced SELECT Statements
- **Purpose**: To extract more complex data from a database.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **SELECT with Functions**: Learn to use built-in SQL functions (like `CONCAT`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `SUBSTRING`) to manipulate and present data.
	- SQL provides a variety of built-in functions that can manipulate column data.
   	- **String Functions** like `CONCAT`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `SUBSTRING` are used to concatenate, change case, or extract parts of strings.
   	- **Date Functions** like `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY` extract parts of a date.
   	- **Aggregate Functions** like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

### String Functions in SQL

#### 1. CONCAT
- **Purpose**: Combines two or more strings into one string.
- **Example**: Suppose you want to combine the first name and last name of employees into a full name.
  ```sql
  SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;
  ```

#### 2. UPPER and LOWER
- **Purpose**: Converts all characters in a string to uppercase or lowercase.
- **Example**: If you need to standardize the names of employees to all uppercase.
  ```sql
  SELECT UPPER(name) AS uppercase_name FROM employees;
  ```

#### 3. SUBSTRING
- **Purpose**: Extracts a substring from a string.
- **Example**: To get the first 5 characters of each employee's name.
  ```sql
  SELECT SUBSTRING(name, 1, 5) AS short_name FROM employees;
  ```

#### 4. LENGTH
- **Purpose**: Returns the length of a string.
- **Example**: To find the length of each employee's name.
  ```sql
  SELECT LENGTH(name) AS name_length FROM employees;
  ```

#### 5. TRIM
- **Purpose**: Removes spaces from the beginning and end of a string.
- **Example**: To remove any leading and trailing spaces from employee names.
  ```sql
  SELECT TRIM(name) AS trimmed_name FROM employees;
  ```

#### 6. REPLACE
- **Purpose**: Replaces occurrences of a specified string.
- **Example**: To replace a part of the string in employee names.
  ```sql
  SELECT REPLACE(name, 'John', 'Jonathan') AS updated_name FROM employees;
  ```

#### 7. POSITION / LOCATE
- **Purpose**: Finds the position of a substring in a string.
- **Example**: To find the position of '@' in the email addresses.
  ```sql
  SELECT POSITION('@' IN email) AS at_position FROM employees;
  ```

These functions are very useful for data manipulation, especially when dealing with inconsistent data formats or preparing data for reports, analysis, or exporting. They allow you to modify and extract exactly what you need from string data.

As you practice these examples, try experimenting by combining functions or applying them to different scenarios in your database. This hands-on practice will help solidify your understanding of string functions in SQL.

  - **Conditional Selection (CASE WHEN)**: Understand how to use `CASE` statements for conditional logic in your queries.

   	- The `CASE` statement in SQL acts like an `if-then-else` in programming.
   	- Allows different outputs to be returned based on conditions.
  	- Can be used in any part of the SQL query where expressions are valid.
Conditional Selection using the `CASE` statement in SQL is a powerful tool for incorporating logical conditions into your queries. It's similar to `if-then-else` logic in programming languages. The `CASE` statement allows you to apply different conditions to each row in a query and return specific values based on these conditions.

### Conditional Selection (CASE WHEN)

#### Basic Structure of CASE

```sql
CASE 
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ...
    ELSE default_result
END
```

#### Use Cases and Examples

1. **Categorizing Data Based on Conditions**:
   - Suppose you want to categorize employees based on their salary into 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'.
     ```sql
     SELECT name, salary, 
         CASE
             WHEN salary < 40000 THEN 'Low'
             WHEN salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 70000 THEN 'Medium'
             ELSE 'High'
         END AS salary_category
     FROM employees;
     ```

2. **Conditional Formatting or Data Representation**:
   - If you want to display a custom message based on the number of years an employee has been with the company.
     ```sql
     SELECT name, hired_date,
         CASE
             WHEN YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(hired_date) <= 5 THEN 'Newbie'
             WHEN YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(hired_date) BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN 'Experienced'
             ELSE 'Veteran'
         END AS experience_level
     FROM employees;
     ```

3. **Conditional Calculations**:
   - Applying different calculations or adjustments to data based on specific criteria.
     ```sql
     SELECT name, sales, 
         CASE
             WHEN sales > 100000 THEN sales * 1.10
             ELSE sales * 1.05
         END AS adjusted_sales
     FROM sales_employees;
     ```

4. **Replacing NULL Values**:
   - Providing default values when the data contains NULLs.
     ```sql
     SELECT name, 
         CASE
             WHEN address IS NULL THEN 'Address not provided'
             ELSE address
         END AS address_info
     FROM employees;
     ```

### Understanding and Applying

- The `CASE` statement adds significant flexibility to your SQL queries, allowing you to incorporate complex logic directly into your data retrieval process.
- It can be used in the `SELECT` list, `WHERE` clause, and even in the `ORDER BY` clause for customized sorting.
- Practical applications include data categorization, custom calculations, data cleansing, and more.

By practicing with these examples and experimenting with different conditions, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to use the `CASE` statement effectively in various scenarios. Remember, the `CASE` statement evaluates conditions in the order they are written and stops at the first true condition, so the order of your conditions can impact the results.

## Advanced Filtering

- **Purpose**: To refine the selection of data based on complex criteria.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Using Operators**: Explore more complex operators like `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, and logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`).
	- **IN**: Allows you to specify multiple values in a `WHERE` clause.
	- **BETWEEN**: Selects values within a given range.
	- **LIKE**: Used for pattern matching with wildcards (`%` for zero or more characters, `_` for a single character).
### 1. IN
- **Purpose**: Allows you to specify multiple possible values for a column.
- **Use Case**: Select employees who are in specific departments.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (1, 3, 5);
  ```

### 2. BETWEEN
- **Purpose**: Selects values within a given range (inclusive of the boundary values).
- **Use Case**: Find employees whose salaries fall within a specific range.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 80000;
  ```

### 3. LIKE and Wildcards
- **Purpose**: Used for pattern matching. `%` represents zero or more characters, `_` represents a single character.
- **Use Case**: Find employees whose names start with 'J'.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
  ```
#### Wildcard Characters
- **`%` Wildcard**: Represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
- **`_` Wildcard**: Represents exactly one character.

#### Examples

1. **Names Starting with a Specific Letter**:
   - To find employees whose names start with "A".
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
     ```
   - `%` means the name can have any characters following "A".

2. **Names Containing a Specific Substring**:
   - To search for employees whose names contain the substring "son".
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE '%son%';
     ```
   - `%son%` matches any names with "son" anywhere in the string.

3. **Names Ending with a Specific Substring**:
   - To find employees whose names end with "er".
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE '%er';
     ```

4. **Specific Character Patterns**:
   - To find employees whose names are exactly five characters long and start with "J".
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'J____';
     ```
   - `'J____'` uses `_` to represent that there must be exactly four characters after "J".

5. **Combining LIKE with Other Conditions**:
   - To find employees named "John" in a specific department.
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'John%' AND department_id = 3;
     ```

6. **Case Sensitivity**:
   - Note: The `LIKE` operator's case sensitivity depends on the database system and collation settings. In some databases, LIKE is case-insensitive by default.

#### Practical Uses

- **Pattern Matching**: `LIKE` with wildcards is immensely useful for filtering data based on partial information, like finding all products whose names start with a certain word, or all customers whose email addresses are from a certain domain.
- **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: Useful in data analysis tasks for segregating data into various categories based on string patterns.

Experimenting with these examples in your database will give you a better understanding of how `LIKE` and wildcards can be used in different scenarios to filter data based on string patterns. Remember, the versatility of these tools makes them applicable to a wide range of data querying tasks.
  - **Subqueries**: Learn how to use subqueries (a query nested within another query) for advanced filtering.
	- A subquery is a query nested inside another query.
	- Used for complex filtering, where the output of the inner query serves as input to the outer query.
	- Can be used in `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` clauses.

### 4. Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- **AND**: Combines multiple conditions, all of which must be true.
- **OR**: At least one of the conditions must be true.
- **NOT**: Negates a condition.
- **Use Case**: Select employees who are either Managers or have a salary above a certain threshold.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE position = 'Manager' OR salary > 70000;
  ```

### Understanding and Applying

- These operators enhance the power and flexibility of your SQL queries.
- They can be combined in various ways to create complex filtering conditions.
- Ideal for scenarios where you need to segment data, perform range-based analysis, or match patterns.

By practicing these operators, you'll be able to construct more nuanced and targeted queries, enabling detailed analysis and data extraction based on specific criteria. Experiment with different combinations of these operators to see how they can be used to answer diverse data questions.


## Advanced Sorting

- **Purpose**: To organize the output of your queries in more sophisticated ways.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Sorting by Multiple Columns**: Discover how to sort data by more than one column.

	- Allows sorting of data by more than one column, with each column sorted individually.
	- For example, sorting by department, and then within each department, sort by salary.
Certainly! Sorting by multiple columns in SQL is an important technique for organizing your query results in a more detailed and hierarchical manner. Let's delve into the concept and look at some practical examples.

### Sorting by Multiple Columns

When you sort data in SQL using the `ORDER BY` clause, you can specify multiple columns to define the sorting priority. This is particularly useful when you want to sort data by one column and then further sort within each category of that column by another column.

- **Primary and Secondary Sort Order**: The first column mentioned in the `ORDER BY` clause is the primary sort key. The second column is used to sort records that have the same value in the first column, and so on.
- **ASC and DESC**: You can specify `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending) for each column. If not specified, `ASC` is the default.

#### Examples

1. **Sorting Employees by Department and Salary**:
   - Suppose you want to list employees, first sorted by their department, and within each department, sorted by their salary in descending order.
     ```sql
     SELECT name, department_id, salary
     FROM employees
     ORDER BY department_id ASC, salary DESC;
     ```

2. **Sorting Sales Data by Region and Date**:
   - If you have sales data and you want to sort it first by region and within each region, sort it by date of the sale.
     ```sql
     SELECT sale_date, region, amount
     FROM sales
     ORDER BY region ASC, sale_date DESC;
     ```

3. **Sorting Products by Category and Price**:
   - For a list of products, you might want to sort them first by category, and within each category, by price from lowest to highest.
     ```sql
     SELECT category, name, price
     FROM products
     ORDER BY category ASC, price ASC;
     ```

- **Hierarchical Sorting**: This method of sorting is like sorting a deck of cards by suit and then within each suit, sorting by rank.
- **Flexibility**: You can add as many columns as needed in the `ORDER BY` clause to achieve the desired sorting hierarchy.
- **Real-world Application**: This approach is commonly used in reports, data analysis, and anywhere where data needs to be presented in a structured and organized manner.

  - **Custom Sorting Order**: Use `CASE` statements or functions within the `ORDER BY` clause to achieve custom sorting criteria.
   	- Custom sorting can be achieved using `CASE` or functions within the `ORDER BY` clause.
   	- Allows for non-standard sorting criteria, like sorting by a specific custom priority.

Custom Sorting Order in SQL allows you to define a specific, non-standard order for your query results. This can be particularly useful when the desired sort order doesn't align with the usual ascending or descending sequence. Let's explore this concept with an example.

### Custom Sorting Order

- Custom sorting is typically implemented using a `CASE` statement within the `ORDER BY` clause.
- It allows you to define specific sorting rules that go beyond simple ascending or descending order.

- **CASE in ORDER BY**: The `CASE` statement in the `ORDER BY` clause assigns a custom sort order to each row.
- **Sorting Logic**: You define the order based on specific conditions or values of columns.

#### Example: Custom Sorting Employees by Position

Suppose you have a table of employees and you want to sort them by their position, but in a specific order: Managers first, then Engineers, and all other positions last.

```sql
SELECT name, position
FROM employees
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN position = 'Manager' THEN 1
        WHEN position = 'Engineer' THEN 2
        ELSE 3
    END;
```

In this example:
- Employees who are Managers will be assigned a sort value of 1.
- Engineers will be assigned 2.
- All other positions will get 3.
- The `ORDER BY` clause will then sort by these assigned values.

To sort the names alphabetically within each position group, you would add the `name` column to the `ORDER BY` clause after the `CASE` statement. Here’s how the modified query would look:

```sql
SELECT name, position
FROM employees
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN position = 'Manager' THEN 1
        WHEN position = 'Engineer' THEN 2
        ELSE 3
    END,
    name;
```

With this adjustment, the query does two levels of sorting:

1. First, it sorts by position, giving Managers the highest priority, then Engineers, and then all other positions.
2. Within each position group, it sorts the employees alphabetically by their name.

So, if you have multiple Managers or Engineers, they will be listed alphabetically in their respective groups. This approach provides a more organized and readable output, especially when dealing with larger datasets.

#### Understanding and Applying

- **Control Over Order**: Custom sorting gives you precise control over the order of your results, based on the actual content of the rows.
- **Flexibility**: This method is extremely flexible and can be adapted to many different scenarios where standard sorting isn't adequate.
- **Real-world Application**: Useful in reports or user interfaces where data needs to be presented in an order that makes sense to the end-users but doesn't necessarily follow alphabetical or numeric order.

Custom sorting order is a powerful tool in SQL, enabling you to tailor the order of your query results to match specific business logic or user requirements. By practicing with the `CASE` statement in the `ORDER BY` clause, you can handle even the most complex sorting requirements.

To practice these advanced concepts, let's consider a series of exercises. Work through these tasks and push your SQL scripts and findings to your GitHub repository.

1. **Using Functions in SELECT**:
   - Write a query to list all employees, combining their `name` and `position` in a single column with a custom format.
   - Convert the `name` of all employees to uppercase in a query.

2. **Conditional Selection**:
   - Use a `CASE` statement to categorize employees into different salary brackets (e.g., 'Low', 'Medium', 'High').

3. **Complex Filtering**:
   - Find all employees who are either 'Software Engineers' or 'Project Managers' and have salaries above a certain threshold.
   - Use a subquery to find employees who were hired more recently than the average hire date.

4. **Advanced Sorting**:
   - Sort employees first by their department and then by their salary within each department.
   - Create a custom sorting order for the position, where 'Manager' comes first, followed by 'Engineer', and then others.
