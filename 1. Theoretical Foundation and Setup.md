# Theoretical Foundation and Setup

This document outlines the steps and exercises I've undertaken in my journey to learn SQL.

## Initial Setup

- Installed MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench.
- Created a GitHub repository to track my SQL scripts and learning progress.

## SQL Basics

- Created my first database named `testdb`.
  
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE testdb;
  ```
- Created a table called employees to store employee records.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, 
    name VARCHAR(100),
    position VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    hired_date DATE
);
-- Inserted a record into the employees table.
INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary, hired_date)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'Software Engineer', 60000, '2021-01-15');

-- Retrieved all records from the employees table.
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Retrieved records for employees with the position 'Software Engineer'.
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE position = 'Software Engineer';

```
## Handling Errors
Encountered an issue with duplicate entries and learned about UNIQUE constraints.
The problem can be solved in various ways. Yet the easiest way to do is to proceed as follow

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
previous entries
-- Solving the issue
UNIQUE(name, hired_date)
);
```
There are other ways to solve this problem but this would require advanced knowledge. The proposed solution requires yet to delete the actual table and re-run the query. If the table was created without the UNIQUE constraint initially and you added it later, any existing duplicate entries from before the constraint was added would not be automatically removed. You'd need to manually delete the duplicate entries before adding the constraint, or drop and recreate the table with the constraint in place.
